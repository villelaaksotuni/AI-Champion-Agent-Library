# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Tech evaluators and executives can find the right AI agent for their use case within seconds — through semantic search or category browsing — and understand what it does, how it works, and how to get it.
**Current focus:** Phases 1, 5, 6, and 7 are complete. Phase 2 is functionally done (3/4 plans) but its human-verification checkpoint (02-04) was never executed. Phases 3 (Search) and 4 (Customization Placeholder) are not started — no plans exist yet for either.

## Current Position

Phase: 07 of 7 (No-Container Demo Backend for Try It Out) — COMPLETE (verified 2026-08-20, 9/9 success criteria)
Plan: 5 of 5 in Phase 7
Status: Paused — all assigned plans across Phases 1, 5, 6, 7 complete. Phase 2 has an unexecuted checkpoint (02-04-PLAN.md); Phases 3/4 not started.
Last activity: 2026-08-20 — Phase 7 Plan 5 (`?job=` session persistence + live E2E verification) completed and human-approved

Progress: [█████████░] 94%

## Missing / Open Work

Not "missing" in the sense of lost work — these are legitimate gaps in the roadmap's execution, listed here so a future session doesn't have to rediscover them:

- **02-04-PLAN.md** (Phase 2, human-verification checkpoint for catalog and detail pages) has a PLAN.md but no SUMMARY.md — it was never executed. Phase 2 is otherwise functionally complete (browse, filter, detail page, responsive layout all shipped and tested in 02-01..02-03).
- **Phase 3 (Search)** has a phase directory (`.planning/phases/03-search/`) but it is empty — no CONTEXT/RESEARCH/PLAN files exist yet. Requirements SRCH-01..03 are defined in REQUIREMENTS.md but unmapped to any plan.
- **Phase 4 (Customization Placeholder)** has no phase directory at all yet. Requirement CUST-01 is defined but unmapped to any plan.
- Neither gap blocks Phases 5-7 (the Try It Out initiative), which branched off Phase 2 and does not depend on Phase 3 or 4.

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: ~11 min
- Total execution time: ~2.7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total Duration | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| 01 — Data Pipeline | 2/2 | 12 min | 6 min |
| 02 — Catalog and Detail | 3/4 | 14 min | ~4.7 min |
| 05 — Try It Out Field | 2/2 | ~25 min | ~12.5 min |
| 06 — Runnable Try It Out Flow (mock) | 3/3 | 25 min | ~8.3 min |
| 07 — No-Container Demo Backend | 5/5 | ~88 min | ~17.6 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans (07-01 → 07-05): 16min, 6min, 20min, 24min, ~22min
- Trend: Stable-to-increasing — later Phase 7 plans (server routes, live-API wiring) took longer than the earlier scaffolding/preflight plans, consistent with increasing integration surface per plan.

**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01-01 | 6 min | 1 | 13 |
| 01-02 | 6 min | 2 | 6 |
| 02-01 | 6 min | 3 | 18 |
| 02-02 | 4 min | 2 | 7 |
| 02-03 | 4 min | 1 | 8 |
| 05-01 | ~15 min | 2 | 4 |
| 05-02 | 10 min | 3 | 2 |
| 06-01 | 5 min | 3 | 6 |
| 06-02 | 4 min | 3 | 2 |
| 06-03 | 16 min | 2 | 1 |
| 07-01 | 16 min | 4 | 6 |
| 07-02 | 6 min | 2 | 6 |
| 07-03 | 20 min | 3 | 7 |
| 07-04 | 24 min | 3 | 9 |
| 07-05 | ~22 min | 3 | 5 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Oracle AgentSpec is the canonical source format; shim/adapter layer is mandatory before any UI work
- [Pre-Phase 1]: In-memory/SQLite search — no external vector DB at ~300 agents
- [Pre-Phase 1]: v1 = public catalog only, no auth, no deployment
- [Phase 01-01]: AgentRecord field names are driven by UI/search needs, not AgentSpec structure — enforced by types.test.ts PIPE-02 assertion
- [Phase 01-01]: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()) is the correct Zod 4 API for open metadata fields — z.record(z.unknown()) is Zod 3 only
- [Phase 01-01]: Shim boundary: Oracle AgentSpec field names confined to oracle-agentspec.ts; never appear in consumers
- [Phase 01-02]: Build script uses echo placeholder for vite build — SvelteKit scaffold deferred to Phase 2
- [Phase 01-02]: Added baseUrl to tsconfig.json to fix drizzle-kit path resolution with paths config
- [Phase 01-02]: Drizzle upsert pattern: onConflictDoUpdate with excluded.* SQL templates — never plain INSERT for idempotent ingestion
- [Phase 02-01]: svelte.config.js not .ts — Node.js ESM loader cannot load .ts; SvelteKit requires .js extension for config
- [Phase 02-01]: Manual SvelteKit scaffold (deps + files) over npx sv create — interactive CLI blocked automation
- [Phase 02-01]: Kept baseUrl in tsconfig.json — required for drizzle-kit; SvelteKit warning is non-blocking
- [Phase 02-01]: Tailwind CSS v4 via @tailwindcss/vite plugin — no postcss config needed
- [Phase 02-02]: Client-side $derived.by() filtering avoids server round-trips; goto() replaceState:true updates URL for shareability
- [Phase 02-02]: vi.mock() with call counter for Drizzle chain mocking — two db.select() calls per load function need different return values
- [Phase 02-03]: svelteTesting() vite plugin required alongside sveltekit() for @testing-library/svelte to use browser Svelte (not SSR) in jsdom tests
- [Phase 02-03]: vitest.config.ts needs sveltekit() plugin to resolve $lib alias and transform .svelte files in tests
- [Phase 02-03]: Native <details>/<summary> for TechAccordion — no JS library, keyboard accessible by default, collapsed with no open attribute
- [Phase 05]: 05-02: flattenRecord() writes literal try_it_out defaults; onConflictDoUpdate deliberately omits the three try_it_out columns so re-ingestion never clobbers a manually-set value (D-06/D-07)
- [Phase 05]: 05-02: User decision — hvac-load-calculator stays try_it_out_mode='runnable' in the dev DB (not reset to 'none') so Phase 6's working TryItOutPanel demo remains live
- [Phase 06-01]: advanceTimersByTimeAsync + tick (imported from svelte) works cleanly for Svelte 5 rune components under vitest fake timers — no real-timer waitFor fallback needed
- [Phase 06-01]: Shipped exact contract regex /(^|\W)fail(\W|$)/i verbatim per D-06's authoritative clause; 'failure'/'failing' correctly do NOT trigger the fail path (D-06 prose was wrong on this point)
- [Phase 06]: Auto-scroll observation: Object.defineProperty accessor-pair recorder for scrollTop chosen directly over vi.spyOn(el, prop, 'set') for jsdom compatibility
- [Phase 06]: Cleanup-assertion variant: vi.getTimerCount() under fake timers worked cleanly with unmount(); no real-timer clearTimeout-spy fallback needed
- [Phase 06]: Task 3 required no production fix — 06-01's unsubscribe-on-terminal/unsubscribe-on-destroy logic already passed all four cleanup tests
- [Phase 06-03]: COVERAGE.md declares no external API integration (grep-verified); the future runtime phase owns the real API coverage matrix
- [Phase 06-03]: Human checkpoint approved all 10 verification steps with no defects, including both UI-SPEC backstop items (overflow, long-text) — Phase 6 complete
- [Phase 07-01]: `gpt-4.1-mini` at `temperature: 0.2` chosen as the single fixed model/temperature pair after a live `models.list()` + temperature probe against the deployed key (MODEL-PROBE.md); no fallback branch needed
- [Phase 07-02]: `demo-rfi-triage` flipped to `try_it_out_mode: 'runnable'`, `hvac-load-calculator` reverted to `'none'` via the existing one-off `scripts/set-try-it-out-mode.ts` (D-13 pattern, never via ingest)
- [Phase 07-04]: POST handler captures `job.status` immediately after `createJob` (before firing the fire-and-forget `runJob`) — reading it after would observe `'running'`, not the SC-01-mandated `'queued'`, since `runJob`'s first statement runs synchronously before its first `await`
- [Phase 07-05]: `writeJobIdToUrl`/`clearJobIdFromUrl` kept synchronous per the frozen `?job=` helper signatures by importing `$app/navigation`'s `replaceState` statically and wrapping only the call site in try/catch (never the import) — preserves SSR/router-optional safety without forcing an async signature
- [Phase 07-05]: `fakeJobApi.ts`'s test-stub jobId generation switched from an arbitrary `"fake-job-N"` string to `crypto.randomUUID()` to match the real backend's actual ID scheme — required for the UUID-validated `?job=` write path to be testable at all
- [Post-Phase 7 housekeeping]: Fixed a latent bug in `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/lib/state.cjs`'s `cmdStateUpdateProgress` — its plain `Progress:` regex was unanchored to the document body and could match this file's own YAML frontmatter `progress:` key, clobbering it on write. Now scoped to the body only.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Oracle AgentSpec field structure not directly inspected — must obtain actual spec files or schema before implementing PIPE-01/PIPE-02 (research gap flagged). *Note: Phase 1 has since shipped and closed PIPE-01/02 — this blocker predates that and can likely be retired; left here pending explicit confirmation.*
- Embedding model selection (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 recommended) needs validation against real agent descriptions before Phase 3 commits to it — still open; Phase 3 has not started.
- Phase 2's 02-04 human-verification checkpoint was never executed — Phase 2 cannot be marked fully complete until it runs (or is explicitly waived).

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
|---|-------------|------|--------|-----------|
| 260819-nsi | Hide the existing Try It Out panel behind a collapsible arrow control on the runnable agent detail page; clicking reveals it inline below the control. No changes to TryItOutPanel.svelte or tryItOut.ts. | 2026-08-19 | e5e4157 | [260819-nsi-hide-the-existing-try-it-out-panel-behin](./quick/260819-nsi-hide-the-existing-try-it-out-panel-behin/) |

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 5 added: Try It Out Field — optional try_it_out mode (none|external|runnable) on agent records, threaded through schema/ingest/detail page
- Phase 6 added: Runnable Try It Out Flow (mock-backed) — src/lib/tryItOut.ts (submitJob/subscribeProgress/downloadArtifact) + TryItOutPanel.svelte, shaped to docs/job-api-contract.md, no real backend
- Phase 7 added: No-Container Demo Backend for Try It Out — real (but no-Docker/no-pi) SvelteKit server routes that call an LLM with the agent's base prompt + skill.md, replacing tryItOut.ts's mock with real fetch() calls; UI unchanged
- Phase 8 added: Container-backed Try It Out (warm on visit) — when a user opens an agent page, warm a container with Pi and that agent's skill; Try It Out runs in it behind the existing job API. Inspired by GAISE26_tool_building_pi_agents (idea only, not code). Delegated by Jussi.
- Phases 5, 6, and 7 together form one continuous "Try It Out" initiative, executed as a self-contained branch off Phase 2 — independent of, and completed ahead of, Phases 3 and 4.

# Roadmap: AIC Agent Library

## Overview

The original four phases deliver a public browse-and-discovery catalog for 100+ AI agents. The data pipeline is the foundational dependency — nothing else can be built until normalized agent data flows through the shim layer. Catalog browse and agent detail pages come next, sharing the same component surface. Hybrid search follows once the detail page components and curated semantic summary fields exist. The customization placeholder closes out v1 as an isolated, low-risk addition.

Phases 5-7 were added after the fact (see "Roadmap Evolution" in STATE.md) as a self-contained "Try It Out" initiative, branching off Phase 2 rather than blocking on Phase 3/4: Phase 5 adds the optional `try_it_out` field to the catalog shape, Phase 6 builds a mock-backed runnable demo flow against a frozen client contract, and Phase 7 replaces the mock with a real (no-container) SvelteKit backend that calls an LLM directly. All three are complete; Phases 3 and 4 remain not started and are independent of this work.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Data Pipeline** - Canonical data model, Oracle AgentSpec ingestion, SQLite store (completed 2026-03-19)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Catalog and Detail** - Browse page, agent detail page, responsive layout
- [ ] **Phase 3: Search** - Hybrid keyword + semantic search with live results
- [ ] **Phase 4: Customization Placeholder** - Customize button and visible-but-non-functional menu
- [x] **Phase 5: Try It Out Field** - Optional try_it_out field (none/external/runnable) threaded through schema, ingest, and detail page (completed 2026-08-19)
- [x] **Phase 6: Runnable Try It Out Flow (mock-backed)** - Mock-backed job client + panel for runnable mode, contract-shaped for a later real backend swap
- [x] **Phase 7: No-Container Demo Backend for Try It Out** - Real (no-Docker/no-pi) SvelteKit server routes calling an LLM, replacing the mock client (completed 2026-08-20)
- [ ] **Phase 8: Container-backed Try It Out (warm on visit)** - Pi + skill container warmed when an agent page is opened; runs behind the existing job API

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Data Pipeline

**Goal**: Structured, normalized agent data flows from source YAML files through the shim layer into a queryable SQLite store
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: PIPE-01, PIPE-02, PIPE-03, PIPE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Running the ingestion script against a directory of Oracle AgentSpec YAML files produces a populated SQLite database with one `AgentRecord` row per file
  2. Re-running ingestion on the same files produces identical records — no duplicates, `last_ingested_at` timestamp updated
  3. A malformed or invalid YAML file causes Zod validation to fail with a clear error message, leaving valid records unaffected
  4. No Oracle AgentSpec field names appear in `AgentRecord` — the canonical type uses its own naming
  5. The ingestion script runs as part of the build step without manual intervention

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — AgentRecord canonical type, Oracle AgentSpec Zod schema, adapter registry, and unit tests
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Drizzle ORM schema, ingestion script with upsert semantics, build-step integration, and integration tests

### Phase 2: Catalog and Detail

**Goal**: Users can browse the agent catalog, filter by category and attributes, and read agent detail pages with progressive disclosure for dual audiences
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: BROW-01, BROW-02, BROW-03, DETL-01, DETL-02, DETL-03, UI-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User can browse a paginated catalog page organized by domain/function categories without layout degradation at 100+ agents
  2. User can filter the catalog by at least three attributes (e.g., LLM, tools, deployment type) and see results update without a page reload
  3. User can open an agent detail page that shows name, purpose, use cases, and a GitHub link by default — no technical details visible until expanded
  4. User can expand a collapsible technical specification section to see LLM, tools, memory system, invocation, and deployment details
  5. User can see which fields of the agent are tailorable in a customization panel on the detail page
  6. All pages are usable on desktop and tablet viewports without horizontal scrolling or broken layouts

**Plans:** 3/4 plans executed

Plans:

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — SvelteKit scaffold, Tailwind CSS v4, adapter-node, db singleton, tailorable fields config, Wave 0 test skeletons
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Catalog browse page with AgentCard, FilterBar (3 filters: category, model, status), Pagination, responsive grid
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Agent detail page with progressive disclosure, TechAccordion, CustomizationPanel
- [ ] 02-04-PLAN.md — Human verification checkpoint for catalog and detail pages (not yet executed)

### Phase 3: Search

**Goal**: Users can find agents using natural language queries or short keywords, with results appearing live as they type
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: SRCH-01, SRCH-02, SRCH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User can type a natural language query (e.g., "automate customer support") into a search bar and see semantically relevant agents ranked at the top
  2. User can type a short keyword (e.g., "SQL") and get reliable results that include agents with exact keyword matches even if embedding similarity is low
  3. Search results update live as the user types — no submit button required
  4. A labeled test set of 20+ query/result pairs passes with acceptable ranking accuracy before search is declared done

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 03-01: Embedding generation script, embeddings stored in SQLite, search module with cosine similarity
- [ ] 03-02: BM25 keyword scoring, hybrid ranking, SearchBar component, and search result rendering
- [ ] 03-03: Search validation — 20-query labeled test set, model selection confirmation

### Phase 4: Customization Placeholder

**Goal**: The customization entry point is visible and accessible on agent detail pages, surfacing future wizard flows without implementing them
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: CUST-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User can see a "Customize" button on every agent detail page
  2. Clicking "Customize" opens a menu showing available customization options — items are clearly labeled but clicking them produces a "coming soon" or disabled state, not an error

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 04-01: Customize button, dropdown menu with placeholder items, and disabled state handling

### Phase 5: Try It Out Field

**Goal:** Agent records support an optional `try_it_out` field (mode: none | external | runnable, url, task_template) threaded through the Drizzle schema, ingest script, and agent detail page. External mode renders a working "Try it out" link; runnable mode renders a disabled button; none/missing renders nothing. No runtime is built. One agent (e.g. rfi-triage-assistant) is set to external with a placeholder url as a working example.
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Requirements**: none assigned (scope defined by 05-CONTEXT.md decisions D-01..D-13)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `drizzle/schema.ts` includes a `try_it_out` field capturing mode (none|external|runnable), url, and task_template
  2. `scripts/ingest.ts` parses and writes `try_it_out` data for agents that define it
  3. Agent detail page renders: nothing for none/missing, a working link for external, a disabled button for runnable
  4. One agent (e.g. rfi-triage-assistant) has mode: external with a placeholder url visible on its detail page
  5. No runtime execution behavior is added for runnable mode

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Tracer: try_it_out_* schema columns applied to the DB, mode-conditional Try It Out affordance on the agent detail page (external link / disabled runnable button / nothing), rfi-triage-assistant set to external with a placeholder URL
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Ingestion safe defaults + no-clobber onConflictDoUpdate omission with regression tests, full-build durability check, human verification of all three modes

### Phase 6: Runnable Try It Out Flow (mock-backed)

**Goal:** Build a mock-backed, contract-shaped "Try It Out" runnable flow that demos end-to-end with no real backend: a client layer (`src/lib/tryItOut.ts`) exposing exactly `submitJob`, `subscribeProgress`, and `downloadArtifact` per `docs/job-api-contract.md`'s frozen signatures, and a Svelte 5 `TryItOutPanel.svelte` wired into the agent detail page's `runnable` mode (replacing Phase 5's disabled placeholder button), also usable standalone with a hardcoded agentId. Swapping mock → real backend later must touch only `tryItOut.ts`, never the UI.
**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Requirements**: none assigned (scope defined by `docs/job-api-contract.md` and user-specified success criteria below)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `src/lib/tryItOut.ts` exposes `submitJob`, `subscribeProgress`, `downloadArtifact` — all mock-backed and contract-shaped; a later real-backend swap touches only this file
  2. Mock progress events look like real `pi` tool_execution output, with timestamps (e.g. "read data/sample.csv", "read data/sample.csv (12 lines)", "write output/result.txt")
  3. `TryItOutPanel.svelte` renders a task textarea, optional file input, Run button, a live auto-scrolling progress feed, a "Download results" button on success, and a red failed state showing the error
  4. A task containing the word "fail" exercises the failed path so both outcomes are demoable
  5. The panel is wired into the runnable-mode agent detail page AND works standalone with a hardcoded agentId
  6. No real backend exists; the UI only ever calls the three client functions — no `fetch`/`EventSource`/endpoint references anywhere else in the UI

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Tracer: complete frozen mock client (`src/lib/tryItOut.ts` — submitJob/subscribeProgress/downloadArtifact + the 4 contract types, success and fail scripts), tracer `TryItOutPanel.svelte` (Task textarea, Run, live timestamped feed), and the runnable-mode detail-page wiring replacing Phase 5's disabled button

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Panel expansion: red "Job failed" block, "Download results" button, optional file input, bounded auto-scrolling monospace log box, plus unmount/terminal/re-run subscription-cleanup tests

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — COVERAGE.md no-external-API declaration, staged runnable demo row in the dev DB, and human verification of both outcomes in a browser

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7
Note: Phase 4 depends only on Phase 2 and can begin after Phase 2 completes; it does not require Phase 3. Phase 5 depends only on Phase 2 and can begin any time after Phase 2 completes. Phase 6 depends on Phase 5 (replaces its disabled runnable button). Phase 7 depends on Phase 6 (rewires the mock client to a real backend). Phases 5, 6, and 7 together form one continuous "Try It Out" initiative (field → mock flow → real demo backend) and were executed as a self-contained branch off Phase 2, independent of — and now ahead of — Phases 3/4.

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Data Pipeline | 2/2 | Complete   | 2026-03-19 |
| 2. Catalog and Detail | 3/4 | In Progress|  |
| 3. Search | 0/3 | Not started | - |
| 4. Customization Placeholder | 0/1 | Not started | - |
| 5. Try It Out Field | 2/2 | Complete    | 2026-08-19 |
| 6. Runnable Try It Out Flow (mock-backed) | 3/3 | Complete    | 2026-08-19 |
| 7. No-Container Demo Backend for Try It Out | 5/5 | Complete    | 2026-08-20 |

### Phase 7: No-Container Demo Backend for Try It Out

**Goal:** Replace the mock-backed Try It Out client with a real (but "cheating") demo backend: no Docker, no `pi`, no parallelism, no worker containers — plain SvelteKit server routes that actually call an LLM. `POST /api/tryitout/jobs` accepts `agentId`, `task`, and an optional uploaded file; creates a session UUID that acts as a fake container ID (`jobId`); writes the uploaded file to a `jobId`-prefixed server folder (e.g. `.tryitout-work/<jobId>/input/`) — isolation is by UUID prefix only, and file-collision risk is knowingly accepted for the demo. The backend loads the agent's hardcoded base prompt and its `skill.md` from files shipped with the app (pretending to fetch a "container prompt" by container ID, but actually reading locally) — demos are restricted to agents that only need to read the input file and write an output file. It then calls a language model with the base prompt + skill.md + uploaded file contents, writes the result to `.tryitout-work/<jobId>/output/`, and updates job status `queued → running → succeeded` (or `failed` with an error string) — progress is staged status only, no live tool-event feed, since a single LLM call has no tool stream. `GET /api/tryitout/jobs/:id` returns a `JobUpdate` (`{ status, events, error }`) with staged progress lines; `GET /api/tryitout/jobs/:id/artifact` returns the output file as a download, valid only when `status: 'succeeded'`. Job state lives in server memory keyed by `jobId`; the client persists `jobId` (URL `?job=` or a cookie) so refreshing mid-session restores the view and the finished result/download stays available. `src/lib/tryItOut.ts` is rewired to call these routes via real `fetch()` — the three function signatures (`submitJob`, `subscribeProgress`, `downloadArtifact`) stay identical, and the UI components (including Phase 6's disclosure panel) are unchanged. The LLM provider and API key are supplied server-side only (env var on deploy), never sent to the client.
**Requirements**: none assigned (scope defined by user-specified success criteria below)
**Depends on:** Phase 6
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `POST /jobs` creates a `jobId` that acts as a fake container ID; no container or `pi` is started
  2. The uploaded file is written to a `jobId`-prefixed server folder
  3. For the given `agentId` the backend loads BOTH the hardcoded base prompt AND the agent's `skill.md` from the package, and passes both plus the uploaded file to the model
  4. Backend calls the language model, writes an output file, and status goes `queued → running → succeeded` (or `failed` with an error)
  5. Progress is staged status only (no live tool-event feed); download brightens on success
  6. GET status and GET artifact work; download returns the real generated result
  7. `src/lib/tryItOut.ts` calls the routes via `fetch`; UI components (incl. the Phase 6 panel) unchanged
  8. `jobId` is persisted on the client and survives a refresh in the same session; the finished result and download remain available
  9. The LLM provider/key are server-side only, never exposed to the client

**Plans:** 5/5 plans executed in 4 waves

Plans:
**Wave 1** *(parallel)*

- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Preflight: install the `openai` SDK, probe the deployed key with `models.list()` to resolve the model ID and whether custom `temperature` is accepted, freeze both into `src/lib/server/tryItOutModel.ts` behind a decision checkpoint (D-07 costly reversibility)
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Demo assets: `data/agents/demo-rfi-triage.yaml` + shipped `skill.md` + sample RFI, one-off DB `UPDATE` flipping `demo-rfi-triage` to runnable and `hvac-load-calculator` back to none, `.tryitout-work/` gitignore

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Server core: in-memory job store with UUID-validated path helpers, base-prompt (DB) + `skill.md` (file) loader with agentId validation, and the staged runner making the single real OpenAI call

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 07-04-PLAN.md — The three `+server.ts` job routes (POST create / GET status / GET artifact) and the `src/lib/tryItOut.ts` mock-to-`fetch` rewire, with the Phase 6 test suite migrated to a fetch stub and UI components untouched

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3)*

- [x] 07-05-PLAN.md — `?job=` refresh persistence (SC-08) via a transport-free session helper plus minimal additive panel wiring, then live end-to-end human verification against the real OpenAI API

### Phase 8: Container-backed Try It Out (warm on visit)

**Goal:** Opening an agent's detail page warms a container running Pi with that agent's skill, so Try It Out runs in it behind the existing job API with no cold-start wait. Replaces the direct-LLM runner from Phase 7, which stays as fallback.
**Requirements**: TBD
**Depends on:** Phase 7
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (run /gsd-plan-phase 8 to break down)
